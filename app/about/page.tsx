        Hats off to Ishan for dropping these mind-bending visuals, straight out
        of the Midjourney magic on his Twitter¹. <br />I was captivated by the
        pictures and felt compelled to share this the beauty and wonder
        encapsulated in each image with a wider audience. Feel free to share
        your thoughts, you can reach me on my Twitter². <br />
