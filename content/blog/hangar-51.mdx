Hangar 51-B, where spaceships are breakdancing, workers are cha-chaing, and there's
an orange jumpsuit fashion show happening. I grab a jumpsuit, and we assemble for the morning brief.

Amidst the commotion, the USS Enterprise is entering its 10th year of construction,
promising to add a touch of cosmic flair to the already eccentric Hangar 51. As we anxiously

early trial runs.
