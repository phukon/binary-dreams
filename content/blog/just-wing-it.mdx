## Prologue
The smoky backroom of Frankie's joint was buzzing with hushed chatter and the clink of glasses, but today,
the talk was all about rockets. We had this wild idea to launch 'em, ya see? Ugly little contraptions, all
rickety and fragile like grandma's china. But Sal, he's the brains behind this caper, he says we gotta
progress, move forward, and leave the past behind.

So there we were, me and the boys, surrounded by blueprints and schematics that looked more like chicken
scratch than actual plans. Sal, he was pacing like a cat on a hot tin roof, running his hands through his
slicked-back hair like he's tryin' to solve a puzzle.
<br/>
"Listen up, fellas," he says, his voice all gravelly like an old jazz record. "We're gonna launch rockets.
Rockets, I tell ya! It's the future, and the future waits for no one."
<br/>
Now, these rockets ain't exactly the sleek, polished machines you see in them fancy sci-fi movies.
Nah, these babies look like they were put together by a bunch of kids in a junkyard. Ugly as sin,
but Sal's got this gleam in his eye like he's onto something big.
<br/>
We gathered 'round these metal monstrosities, gawking at the mess of wires and tubes like we're
tryin' to decipher some alien language. Frankie, always the skeptic, scratches his head and says,
"Sal, these things look like they'll fall apart faster than a dame in a Marx Brothers movie.
What's the plan here?"

Sal smirks, tosses a cigar in his mouth, and lights it like he's orchestrating a symphony.
"The plan, my dear Frankie, is to wing it. We're gonna wing it like there's no tomorrow.
Progress waits for no one, and we're gonna ride the rocket straight into the future."
<br/>
Well, with that, we start tinkering with them ugly contraptions. Wrenches clinking, wires
sparking, and me muttering under my breath about how we're gonna end up as fireworks
instead of rocketeers. But Sal, he's got this confidence, this swagger like he's the king of the world.
<br/>
Fast as a hiccup, we strap ourselves onto these makeshift rockets, looking more like a bunch
of kids on a dare than a gang of rocket scientists. The countdown begins, and Sal shouts,
"Just wing it, boys!"

And wouldn't ya know it, them rockets sputter, cough, and shoot us straight into the sky.
We're whoopin' and hollerin', Sal's got his arms out like he's flying with the angels,
and even Frankie cracks a smile.
<br/>
We land in a field somewhere, all dusty and disheveled, but we're alive and kickin'. Sal
looks around, takes a deep breath, and says, "Gents, we just winged it into the future.
Rockets and all. Now, who's up for a drink?"
